## **Phase 2: Set Up Development Environment**
### **Milestone: Prepare Tools and Infrastructure**
1. **Set Up n8n:**
   - Install n8n locally or on a cloud server.
   - Explore n8n nodes for HTTP requests, AI integrations, and data transformation.
2. **Set Up Flutter:**
   - Install Flutter SDK and configure it for macOS development.
   - Set up a new Flutter project for your app.
3. **Set Up Figma Integration:**
   - Create a Figma account and generate an API token.
   - Explore Figma's REST API and plugin system.
4. **Set Up AI Models:**
   - Sign up for OpenAI API or other AI services.
   - Test AI models for generating design ideas, wireframes, and user flows.

## **Phase 3: Build Core Features**
### **Milestone 1: Implement Figma Integration**
1. **Connect to Figma API:**
   - Use Figma's REST API to fetch and update design files.
   - Implement endpoints for creating design systems, user flows, and wireframes.
2. **Build a Figma Plugin (Optional):**
   - Create a plugin to interact with your app and n8n workflows.
   - Use the plugin to automate tasks in Figma (e.g., applying styles, creating frames).

### **Milestone 2: Build AI Agent in n8n**
1. **Create Workflows for Design Generation:**
   - Use AI models to generate design systems, user flows, and wireframes.
   - Map AI outputs to Figma's API for creating designs.
2. **Implement Context-Aware Interactions:**
   - Use n8n to capture and process context from user inputs, Figma, and AI models.
   - Build workflows that adapt based on context (e.g., user preferences, design trends).

### **Milestone 3: Build Flutter App**
1. **Design App UI:**
   - Create a clean and intuitive interface for user prompts and design previews.
   - Use Flutter widgets to build the app layout.
2. **Integrate with n8n:**
   - Use HTTP requests or WebSockets to send user prompts to n8n.
   - Display AI-generated designs and Figma outputs in the app.
3. **Implement MCP-Like Functionality:**
   - Build custom logic for context-aware interactions.
   - Use APIs or WebSockets to sync data between the app, n8n, and Figma.

## **Phase 4: Test and Refine**
### **Milestone: Ensure Stability and Usability**
1. **Test Figma Integration:**
   - Verify that designs are created and updated correctly in Figma.
   - Test edge cases (e.g., large files, API rate limits).
2. **Test AI Agent:**
   - Validate AI-generated outputs for accuracy and relevance.
   - Refine prompts and workflows to improve results.
3. **Test Flutter App:**
   - Ensure the app works seamlessly on macOS.
   - Test user interactions, API calls, and error handling.
4. **Gather Feedback:**
   - Share the app with beta testers (e.g., designers, developers).
   - Collect feedback and iterate on the design and functionality.

---

## **Phase 5: Launch and Scale**
### **Milestone: Release the App and Expand Features**
1. **Launch the App:**
   - Publish the macOS app on the App Store or as a downloadable file.
   - Provide documentation and tutorials for users.
2. **Monitor Performance:**
   - Track app usage, API performance, and user feedback.
   - Optimize workflows and AI models based on usage patterns.
3. **Add Advanced Features:**
   - **Real-Time Collaboration:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on designs.
   - **Analytics Dashboard:** Provide insights into design trends and user behavior.
   - **Custom AI Models:** Fine-tune AI models for specific design tasks.
4. **Expand Platforms:**
   - Adapt the app for Windows and Linux using Flutter.
   - Explore mobile versions (iOS, Android) for on-the-go design.

## **Phase 6: Maintain and Improve**
### **Milestone: Ensure Long-Term Success**
1. **Regular Updates:**
   - Fix bugs, improve performance, and add new features.
   - Stay updated with Figma API changes and AI advancements.
2. **Community Engagement:**
   - Build a community of users and contributors.
   - Share tips, templates, and best practices.
